TODO:
1. Bedbugs mating to produce more bedbugs
2. Add obstacles

FEEDBACK:
1. bugs get stuck sometimes and stay in top half
2. More Powerups! (Bug spray, super speed, snack(make time slow down)). They would pop in and out at random times during the game
3. adjusting the click size of the bedbugs
4. add two sets of stairs, as in a cross pattern with one pair running sideways and the other running vertically
5.  have one of the bedbug icons be a Gunny just for laughs
6.  It should be playable after you beat the regular mode. After you beat the regular mode, have a prompt come up and say " Ya think you are hardcore enough for insane mode? Try this out!"
7. have things scale as they beat it more often. Maybe add more bugs, more special bugs, make the bugs smaller/faster, make taps roam earlier or time go faster
8. the interface is very clunky for squishing bugs, perhaps give the player a target reticle.
9. the swatter is OP, perhaps give it a maximum range.
10. the clock is important, but difficult to look at in the middle of a bug squashing massacre, perhaps have important times be flashed on the play area?
